# My Iris Layout

![My Iris Rev3](https://i.imgur.com/7oXacel.jpg)

- mouse keys enabled
- includes a QWERTY and a WORKMAN layout now
- keys that I need, while removing keys that I don't
- more updates with the layout coming soon
  - the enter needs to move elsewhere, not yet sure where

See keymap.c for layouts
